## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Constant-Based Dependency Declarations**
  - Support for dependency constants like `private let TCA = Target.Dependency.product(name: "ComposableArchitecture", package: "swift-composable-architecture")`
  - Resolves constant references in dependency arrays (e.g., `dependencies: [TCA]`)
  - Works with all Swift access levels (`private`, `fileprivate`, `internal`, `public`, `open`)
  - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing dependency declaration methods

- **SwiftSyntax Parser Integration**
  - Added AST-based Package.swift parsing using SwiftSyntax for improved accuracy
  - Configurable parser backend: `--parser swiftsyntax|regex|auto` (default: auto)
  - Auto mode attempts SwiftSyntax first with regex fallback for compatibility
  - SwiftSyntax parser fixes conditional dependency parsing limitations of regex parser

### Fixed
- **Missing Access Modifier Support**
  - Added support for `open` access modifier in dependency constants
  - Fixed parsing of dependency constants without explicit access modifiers (defaults to `internal`)

- **Conditional Product Dependency Parsing**
  - Fixed bug where products declared after conditional dependencies with platform-specific conditions were ignored during parsing
  - Enhanced bracket counting algorithm to properly handle nested brackets within parentheses (e.g., `condition: .when(platforms: [.tvOS])`)
  - Section extraction now correctly ignores square brackets inside parentheses to prevent premature parsing termination
  - Resolves issue where dependencies like `RxSwift` were missed when following conditional products like `MyModuleTV` with platform conditions
